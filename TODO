 - If the trade page is already shown, and the player initiating the
   trade asks for new quotes, it's easy to oversee the changed trade
   parameters in the top line. This should be made clearer somehow,
   e.g. by a beep and/or a note in the messages window.

 - During a setup phase, the client allowed the player to place a road
   nearly everywhere (at least the road cursor was visible). Should
   try to reproduce this and find the cause. Hint: The settlement was
   built first and was on the coast.

 - The meta server should be somehow configurable to:
    - start only a certain max. number of servers on the local machine
    - if this number is reached, start servers on other machines
      (maybe with a proxy meta server running there, or via ssh)
      [Done]
    - be able to restrict access in some forms, maybe based on host
      name and/or IP, and permission to request running server data
      and start new servers

 - Maybe implement ranking of players somehow: In a user's home dir,
   the client could record how often this player won a game, was
   second (point-wise), and so on... The server could collect these
   data on game start, update it at the end and show some statistics.
