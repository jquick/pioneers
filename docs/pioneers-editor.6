.SH NAME
pioneers-editor \- Editor for the Pioneers boardgame

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pioneers-editor
.BI [ filename ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B pioneers-editor
command.
.PP
Pioneers is an implementation of the popular, award-winning "Settlers of
Catan" board game for the GNOME desktop environment.  It uses a client/server
model for networked play of between two and eight players.  You will need to
connect to a machine running either \fBpioneers-server-gtk\fP or
\fBpioneers-server-console\fP to play.  An AI client, \fBpioneersai\fP, is
also available.
.PP
.B Pioneers-editor
can be used to create new board layouts.  Clicking on the plus and minus signs
on the side of the board will increase and decrease the board size
respectively.  Left clicking on a tile allows to select the terrain type;
Middle or right clicking allows setting of the chit number or port type and
orientation.  The chit number can also be set by pressing the number key(s)
while the pointer is hovering over the tile.
.PP
In the settings tab, several game settings can be adjusted.

.SH PLAYING
Games created with pioneers-editor can be played with pioneers-server-gtk and
pioneers-server-console, if they are installed in the global game directory.
Alternatively, they can be played with pioneers-server-console, by using the
.I \-\-file
option.

.SH OPTIONS
Pioneers-editor accepts the standard GTK+/GNOME commandline options.  See
.I pioneers-editor --help
for details.

.SH FILES
.B /usr/share/games/pioneers/*.game
.RS
Global game files.  Games which are installed here can be selected by title,
and played from pioneers-server-gtk.

.SH BUGS
Pioneers allows no-setup nodes, where settlements cannot be placed during the
setup phase.  Pioneers-editor is not able to set such nodes.  As a workaround,
they can be added manually to the game file as a last editing step.
