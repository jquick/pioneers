.SH NAME
pioneers-meta-server \- meta game server for Pioneers

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pioneers-meta-server
.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Pioneers
is an implementation of the popular, award-winning "Settlers of Catan"
board game.  It uses a client/server model for networked play. This program
provides a piece of network infrastructure that helps match pioneers clients to
pioneers servers. Casual players of pioneers probably do not need to run this
program.
